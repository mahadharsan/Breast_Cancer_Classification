# Breast Cancer Study

This project aims to analyze and classify breast cancer data using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the `sklearn` library.

## Objectives
- To import and preprocess the dataset.
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- To build and evaluate machine learning models for breast cancer classification.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `breast_cancer_study.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open `breast_cancer_study.ipynb` and run the cells to reproduce the analysis and results.
